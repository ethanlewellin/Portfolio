summary: "Implementation of core neural network components entirely from scratch in Python and NumPy, following Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela's *Neural Networks from Scratch*."
---

Working through *Neural Networks from Scratch* by Harrison Kinsley and Daniel Kukiela, I implemented every part of a neural network manually using Python and NumPy including neurons, activation functions, loss functions, backpropagation, and optimizers such as SGD, RMSProp, and Adam. My goal was to develop a deep understanding of how neural networks operate internally, beyond the abstractions provided by high-level libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

This project reinforced my knowledge of vectorized computation, matrix algebra, and gradient-based optimization, while building strong intuition for the mathematical and computational structure of deep learning models. The final implementation can train both classification and regression networks entirely from first principles.
